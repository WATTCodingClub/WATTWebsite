Computer science is incredible because it is a field for everyone and anyone. Everyone uses it, and anyone can learn to code. From humble beginnings, a beginner can quickly grow from a beginner into an amateur and from an amateur into a pro simply through some commitment and the help of the internet. CS is also applicable in every field imaginable within our world, especially as our communities becomes more technologically advanced. Therefore, computer scientists belong everywhere!

                        <b>Hobbies and Interests:</b> School and sports are a big part of my life. Since freshman year I’ve been a                           part of Sammamish Rowing Association where I’ve fallen in love with the sport of rowing and all of my                         teammates. In addition to rowing, I have a passion for essentially all outdoor sports, especially                             skiing, hiking, and running. In attending Holy Names Academy I have realized my appreciation for STEM                         based courses and their applicability to everyday life. I obviously have a strong interest in                                 Computer Science and I aspire to introduce more women to the many important careers in STEM. <br>
                        <b>Why she likes computer science:</b> My interest in computer science has greatly increased since beginning                         the AP Computer Science course at Holy Names. The problem solving required for completing the                                 projects has helped me in all other class subjects, especially other math classes. I also have a                             strong appreciation for Comp Sci because computer programming is becoming relevant in essentially all                         professional fields. I see a deficiency of women in Computer Science and I want to do all that I can                         to change that.

Before taking computer science, I found computers                         very intimidating, seeing them only in the cinematically dramatized, world-conquering approach, so                           it's nice to know that we are actually in control and can tell them what to do. In this way, computer                         science opens my mind to endless possibilities and I am excited to share these with others.
